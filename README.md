## üîß Linear Regression Project (42/ft\_linear\_regression)

**A simple machine learning algorithm using gradient descent to predict car prices based on mileage.**

---

### üöÄ Features

* Implements **simple linear regression** from scratch.
* **Gradient descent** training algorithm to optimize parameters.
* **Model persistence**: saves learned coefficients (Œ∏‚ÇÄ and Œ∏‚ÇÅ) for later predictions.
* Predicts car price given mileage using a trained model.
* Optional visualization modules for cost curve and regression fit.

### üîπ Project Files

* `training.py` ‚Äì main training script (reads CSV, trains, saves thetas), return on a separate file the theta for the estimation
* `estimatePrice.py` ‚Äì retrieve the result of the training program and predict price for a provided mileage
* `precision.py` - shows a comparative graph with the estimate linear regression and one found with sklearn lib, and calculte the r¬≤ coefficent
* `data.csv` ‚Äì sample dataset of car mileage vs. price
* `README.md` ‚Äì project overview and usage instructions

---

### üß† Concepts Covered

* Linear regression: modeling the relationship between mileage (feature) and price (target)
* Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as a loss function
* Gradient descent optimization
* Feature scaling (standardization) to avoid learning skewness

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

Make sure you have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) installed.

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Xekhtyrl/Linear_regression_42.git
cd Linear_regression_42
```

Install required packages:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### üß™ Usage

#### Train the model:

```bash
python3 training.py
```

* Input required by the program:

  * file path for the .csv
  * learning rate
  * number of iterations for the algorithm

#### Make predictions:

```bash
python3 estimatePrice.py
```
* Input required by the program:

  * Milleage for estimation
  
Predict price for mileage using saved model.
If no mileage is given or the training program has not been run yet, the program exit with adequate message.

### üèÅ Bonus Features > Calculate Precision:

```bash
python3 precision.py
```
* Input required by the program:

  * .csv path

Require the training program to be executed before. It will give you a visual graphic with two regression
line: One red is the result of the training, the blue is the result of the sklearn method to calculate a linear regression.
The R¬≤ coefficent or the coefficent of determination will also be given in the terminal.

### üåü Why This Project Matters

* First hands‚Äëon introduction to machine learning at 42 network.
* Reinforces Python scripting, CSV processing, basic statistics, plotting, and algorithm implementation. ([GitHub][1])
